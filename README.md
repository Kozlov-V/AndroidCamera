AndroidCamera
=============

This is a minimum Eclipse project demonstrating a weird problem I'm having on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 4.1.1

What's tested and working:

- any number of photos can be captured
- any number of videos can be recorded as well
- even taking a photo while recording works ok (a nice side effect)

BUT, taking a photo *after stopping a recording* (that is, either by hitting the 'Stop Recording' button,
or because the recording is automatically stopped when the maximum file size of 5MB is reached) causes the dreaded
Camera Error 100.

After trying everything I know, it's time to ask for help.

I would be most appreciative if others would test this code on their Android device.

Is it a bug just with my Samsung tablet? If it fails on other devices as well, can anyone tell me
what I'm doing wrong or how to diagnose this further?

Massive positive Karma to anyone helping me fix this :)

With many thanks,

Pete
