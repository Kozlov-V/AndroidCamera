AndroidCamera
=============

An stripped down Eclipse project demonstrating a weird problem I'm having on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 on 4.1.1

What's tested and working:

- any number of photos can be captured happily
- any number of videos can be recorded as well
- even taking a photo while recording works ok

BUT, taking a photo *after stopping a recording* (that is, either by hitting the 'Stop Recording' button,
or when the recording is automatically stopped when the maximum file size of 5MB is reached, causes the dreaded
Camera Error 100.

I've blown two days on this and it's time to ask for help.

I would be most appreciative if people would:

- test this code on their Android devices. Is it a bug just with my tablet?
- tell me what I'm doing wrong as I really shouldn't have to grease it this hard to take a photo after a video!

Lots of positive Karma to any/all kind souls willing to help me fix this :)

Cheers,
Pete
